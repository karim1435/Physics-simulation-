# Physics-simulation

We know that physics is largely applied in real world application. as a teacher i have difficulty to explain the real world problems well,  unlike mathematics, in Math, the challenge to solve real word problem is only how we can model the context in to mathematic exspression. but in physics beside we must know how we can model it mathematically, we must have good understanding what the problem is, and to do that we have to use our imagination, How can we imagine a thing behaves, So this is the reason why teaching physics is different than the other subject.

That is is the main idea why i create this app. I hope this app can be useful for my student to understand the true concept of physics not only they memorize a bunch of spagethi formula.
